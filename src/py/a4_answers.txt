TCP is not suitable for multicast because it uses a direct connection between two hosts.
Since UDP is connectionless and sends individual datagrams it works well for mutlicasting.

The lower the TTL value is the better, since messages sent with a high TTL will travel
around the network much further and cause congestion. We must set the TTL to be greater
than one so it will make it from the client to the server in the testbed. A value of two
is required for the message to get from the client to the server.
